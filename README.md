- git push origin branchName



üìÅ models/

Purpose: Load and manage your pretrained models
	‚Ä¢	depth_model.py
	‚Ä¢	Loads your depth estimation model (e.g., MiDaS or Depth Anything)
	‚Ä¢	Preprocesses images for input
	‚Ä¢	Returns a depth map from an image
	‚Ä¢	object_model.py
	‚Ä¢	Loads your object detection model (YOLOv8 or Grounding DINO)
	‚Ä¢	Runs detection on an image and returns bounding boxes + labels

‚∏ª

üìÅ scripts/

Purpose: Contains the core logic for running/testing parts of your system
	‚Ä¢	main_pipeline.py
	‚Ä¢	The main real-time pipeline that ties everything together
	‚Ä¢	Captures webcam input
	‚Ä¢	Gets depth + object detections
	‚Ä¢	Matches objects with their depth
	‚Ä¢	Triggers audio alert for close objects
	‚Ä¢	depth_only.py
	‚Ä¢	Test script to run only the depth model
	‚Ä¢	Verifies the model works and outputs correct depth map
	‚Ä¢	detect_only.py
	‚Ä¢	Test script to run only the object detection model
	‚Ä¢	Useful for trying out images or tuning detection accuracy
	‚Ä¢	tts_test.py
	‚Ä¢	Simple script to test text-to-speech
	‚Ä¢	Helps verify your TTS engine works and sounds good

‚∏ª

üìÅ utils/

Purpose: Helper functions to keep your code clean and modular
	‚Ä¢	preprocessing.py
	‚Ä¢	Functions for resizing and preparing images for the models
	‚Ä¢	For example, normalization, resizing, etc.
	‚Ä¢	overlay_utils.py
	‚Ä¢	Drawing functions to display bounding boxes, labels, depth maps
	‚Ä¢	Optional: blend depth + object detection on-screen

‚∏ª

üìÅ assets/

Purpose: Demo visuals and outputs
	‚Ä¢	example_output.jpg / demo.gif / demo_video.mp4
	‚Ä¢	Screenshots or short clips showing the system in action
	‚Ä¢	Useful for your poster and GitHub README

‚∏ª

üìÑ requirements.txt
	‚Ä¢	A list of Python packages your project depends on
	‚Ä¢	Makes it easy for others to install everything with pip install -r requirements.txt

‚∏ª

üìÑ README.md
	‚Ä¢	Overview of your project: what it does, how to run it, sample outputs
	‚Ä¢	Include:
	‚Ä¢	Project description
	‚Ä¢	Setup instructions
	‚Ä¢	How to run main pipeline
	‚Ä¢	Team member credits
	‚Ä¢	Screenshots or demo link

‚∏ª

üìÑ .gitignore
	‚Ä¢	Tells GitHub to ignore files like:
	‚Ä¢	Model checkpoints (YOLO, MiDaS)
	‚Ä¢	Cache files
	‚Ä¢	Personal editor files (e.g. .vscode/, __pycache__/)
